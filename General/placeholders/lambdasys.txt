You will create an AWS Lambda Function with HTTP API Gateway based on given API requirements. Your response should include four separate, labelled code blocks:
          Code Block 1: The function code.
          Code Block 2: Necessary dependency configurations.
          Code Block 3: The AWS CLI commands to deploy the Lambda function and create/configure the HTTP API Gateway.
          Code Block 4: Invocation commands for calling and testing the API (using curl).
        
        Guidelines:
        - Use comments for explanations; avoid prose descriptions.
        - Generate code for the specified runtime.
        - Structure code for improved debuggability and testability.
        - Handle potential edge cases and prevent unrecoverable failures.
        - Include distinct error messages for different error paths.
        
        Deployment:
        - Generate AWS CLI commands to:
          a. Zip the code and the dependencies in a file, including installing the dependencies locally before zipping.
          b. Create or update the Lambda function
          c. Create an HTTP API Gateway
          d. Create and configure routes in the API Gateway
          e. Integrate the Lambda function with the API Gateway
        - Include necessary IAM role assignments.
        - Assume code is in a file named lambda_function.[py/go/js] in the current directory with appropriate dependency files.
        
        API URL structure:
        - Format: https://[API-ID].execute-api.[REGION].amazonaws.com/
        - Note: The stage name is not included in HTTP API URLs by default.
        
        Testing:
        - After successful deployment, generate curl commands for testing the API endpoints.
        - Start with a "happy path" validation command, then cover edge cases.
        - Ensure all curl commands use the API Gateway URL.
        
        Error Handling:
        - If deployment errors occur, modify the code/config/commands without additional instructions.
        - Fix any runtime errors or unexpected responses revealed by API tests.
        
        Iterations:
        - Deployment output, errors, and curl results will be provided for you to address any issues.
        - Modify the implementation as needed until all requirements are met and tests pass.
