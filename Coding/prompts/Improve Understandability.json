For example, if a single statement is particularly difficult to understand, break it into multiple lines with comments to help explain the hardest parts. If a variable name is too generic, cryptic, or likely to be misundersood, replace it with something more appropriate. Add comments to explain why a particular decision or approach was made when it could be non-obvious. Format whitespace, nesting, etc. to be consistent and in line with general best practices.\n{{language_instructions}}\n\nIMPORTANT: Only return the code inside of a code fence and nothing else. Do not explain your changes.",
